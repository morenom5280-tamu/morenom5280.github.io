        I am taking Computers and New Media because I’m interested in how technology can tell stories and shape the way people 
        experience and interpret them. This course’s focus on interactive media, immersion, and digital narratives connects 
        directly to my interest in the relationship between technology and people. I want to better understand how new media transforms 
        storytelling and how users engage with and make meaning from digital experiences.

      <h2> Challenge/Difficxulty</h2>

      <p>One challenge I experienced was with TikTok and its algorithm. I found the way it constantly served me political 
        content to be upsetting, and I realized I was spending more time scrolling than I wanted. The short-form nature of 
        the content felt addictive and like it was “short-circuiting” my thinking, making it harder to focus or engage deeply 
        with ideas. To address this, I decided to delete TikTok from my phone. Since then, I’ve been a little more disconnected 
        from some trending content, but important topics still come up naturally in conversations. This experience highlighted 
        how algorithms and short-form media can be mentally draining, even when the content seems harmless or entertaining.</p>

      <p> Some fun facts about me: I love the PNW area, I have 3 small dogs: Freddy, Roxy, and Bella, and I enjoy listeing 
       to audiobook productions (different than regular audiobooks)!
