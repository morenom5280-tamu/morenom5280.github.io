        <h2>Designing With People in Mind</h2>
        <p>
          In Human Cognitive Processes, I learned how the human brain senses, perceives, and interprets 
          information, which pushed me to think beyond functionality and focus on clarity, 
          accessibility, and usability when creating interfaces. HCI gives me tools to think 
          more intentionally about those moments where design meets real people.

        <h2>Learning HCI in a Global Context</h2>
        <p>
          In CSCE 331, I gained hands-on experience working in a team to design a 
          web application with accessibility in mind. The course emphasized 
          designing for diverse users while maintaining a consistent brand identity 
          through intentional color choices, typography, and cohesive styling across 
          multiple interfaces. Studying HCI in Singapore feels especially meaningful because technology
          is shaped by culture, language, and environment. Being immersed in a
          new place challenges my assumptions and helps me think more carefully about who technology is built for.

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          As I move toward a career in software engineering, I want to build systems
          that are not only reliable and efficient, but also intuitive and
          accessible. HCI helps bridge the gap between technical depth and human experience, helping
          me create products that are human-centered, accessible, and responsive to 
          the needs of people from different backgrounds.
